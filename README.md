# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ClassificationProject

Customer churn is a big problem for telecommunications companies. Indeed, their annual churn rates are usually higher than 10%. For that reason, they develop strategies to keep as many clients as possible. This is a classification project since the variable to be predicted is binary (churn or loyal customer). The goal here is to model churn probability, conditioned on the customer features.
