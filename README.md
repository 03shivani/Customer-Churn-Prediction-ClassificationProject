# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ClassificationProject

Customer churn is a big problem for telecommunications companies. Indeed, their annual churn rates are usually higher than 10%. For that reason, they develop strategies to keep as many clients as possible. This is a classification project since the variable to be predicted is binary (churn or loyal customer). The goal here is to model churn probability, conditioned on the customer features.

The Notebook contains exploratory data analysis , Visualisation , Model Building and deployment. In which we use seven different classification models. After tunning hyperparameter we came up to conclusion that the Light Gradient Boosting algorithm is performing well compare to other algorithms , so we finalized the model.

Here we used streamlit for the deployment part.
The deployment section is divided in the two part:
1.EDA 
2.Prediction
 
EDA is further divided into four parts : Descriptive Statistics , Univariate, Bivariate , Multivariate
Prediction : In which we can predict whether the customer will churn or not by putting manual entries and also by uploading dataset.
